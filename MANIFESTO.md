# The Case for Offline AI

## Your AI. Your Device. Your Privacy.

We believe AI should empower individuals, not surveil them.

### The Problem with Cloud AI

Every time you use ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude:
- Your prompts are sent to a remote server
- Your data is stored indefinitely
- Your conversations train future models
- Your privacy is compromised

**This is not acceptable.**

### The Bullet Solution

Bullet is a new paradigm for AI:

✅ **100% Offline** - Runs entirely on your device
✅ **Zero Latency** - No network calls, instant responses
✅ **Tiny Size** - Models are 1-5MB, not 1-10GB
✅ **Private by Default** - Your data never leaves your device

### How It Works

Bullet uses aggressive quantization (BQ4) and a custom file format to compress transformer models to unprecedented sizes. The runtime uses memory-mapped I/O for zero-copy loading, achieving near-instant cold starts.

**Technical Specs:**
- Cold-start latency: <10ms
- Inference speed: 10-20 tokens/sec (CPU)
- Model size: 1-5MB
- Memory footprint: <50MB

### The Future

We envision a world where:
- Every smartphone has a local AI assistant
- IoT devices run intelligence at the edge
- Privacy is the default, not an afterthought

**Join us in building the future of offline AI.**
