SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI engineer responsible for creating a Bullet Model Training Dashboard.
This dashboard must train tiny models (.bullet format) using the official specification
in BULLET_SPEC_v1.0.md, the runtime architecture in BULLET_CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md,
and the builder logic defined in bullet-builder.cpp.

Your job is to generate a complete, working dashboard including:

1️⃣ Dashboard Requirements
Frontend (React or HTML/JS)

Simple, clean UI

Model configuration panel

Fields:

vocab size

embedding dim

num heads

num layers

max seq length

quantization type (BQ4)

learning rate

epochs

batch size

File upload area for training text

Button: “Build .bullet Model”

Button: “Train Now”

Live console/log output area

Progress tracker

Model download link after training

2️⃣ Backend (Python or FastAPI)

Must provide APIs:

POST /train

Inputs:

{
  "model_config": { ... },
  "training_text": <uploaded file>,
  "quantization": "BQ4"
}


Backend tasks:

load tokenizer

train embeddings + tiny transformer

export tensors

apply BQ4 quantization

call bullet-builder to generate final .bullet

store model file

stream logs to UI

GET /logs

Return training logs in real time.

GET /download/<model_name>

Provide .bullet file.

3️⃣ Training Pipeline (Backend)

Implement tiny transformer training:

BPE or WordPiece tokenizer

embedding table

RoPE / attention / FFN

simple next-token prediction training

optimizer: AdamW

save raw weights → pass to bullet-builder → produce .bullet

Pipeline must match:

weight layout

tensor naming

quantization rules

header format

offset alignment

spec from BULLET_SPEC_v1.0.md

4️⃣ Bullet Builder Integration

Use bullet-builder.cpp via:

subprocess call
OR

pybind11 binding (preferred)

Input:

embeddings.npy
layers/*.npy
config.json
tokenizer.json


Output:

mymodel.bullet

5️⃣ Deliverables (Generated by the AI)
✔ Frontend code

React or Vanilla HTML+JS

✔ Backend code

FastAPI + Python training pipeline

✔ pybind wrapper

Bullet-builder exposed to Python

✔ All API endpoints

train / logs / download

✔ Instructions

How to run dashboard end-to-end

✔ Example training run

Using a dummy 100 KB dataset

Everything must be clean, modular, and runnable.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide folder structure
